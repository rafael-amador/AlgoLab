/*
This program will serve as a benchmark on java alogirthms.
This program will consist of these files:
- App.java : Main file to run the program
- Sorts.java : File containing sorting algorithms
- Searches.java : File containing searching algorithms
- Node.java : File containing the Node class for data structures
- LinkedList.java : File containing linked list implementation
- Stack.java : File containing stack implementation
- Queue.java : File containing queue implementation
- Tree.java : File containing tree implementation
- Graph.java : File containing graph implementation

As well as multiple text files containing data to be used for benchmarking.
Such as:
- InfixProblems.txt
- emplyees.txt
- numbers.txt
- words.txt
- etc.

The program will use App as the driver file to run all algorithms.
Program will have a multi-layer menu that looks like this:
Select data structure:
1.linked list
2.tree
3.stack
4.queue
5.graph
6.Objects

Select action:
1.insert
2.search
3.delete
4.display
5.update


Main Menu:
1. Sorting Algorithms
    1. Bubble Sort
    2. Selection Sort
    3. Insertion Sort    
2. Searching Algorithms
    1. Linear Search
    2. Binary Search
3. Data Structures
    1. Linked List
        1. insert
        2. delete
        3. display
    2. Stack
        1. push
        2. pop
        3. display
    3. Queue
        1. enqueue
        2. dequeue
        3. display
    4. Tree
        1. insert
        2. delete
        3. display
    5. Graph
        1. add vertex
        2. add edge
        3. display
4. Exit
